## Day -4: 29 Dec 16

During the winter break I have taken it upon myself to refresh on HTML/CSS and learn a bit about JavaScript. As a SharePoint admin, I'll be putting what I learn to use manipulate page presentation and providing users with widgets. During my studies I came across the 100DaysOfCode and thought I would give it a try.

One of the [articles](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645) that it references resonates true in that it is not enough to follow tutorials to learn new skills. My thought is that doing tutorials feels a bit like navigating by GPS. Yeah, you'll get to the destination, but you will be following proscribed steps fed turn-by-turn.

One of the things that I used to do when I was younger (and had free-time on my hands [no family, no full-time school]) and moved to a new place was to drive out into the middle nowhere then find my way back home. A full tank of gas, a pack of cigarettes (quit in 2008) and a soda were the only things that I needed to find my way back. By the time I made it back home, I knew my way around the area and found places that I would have known about had I been following an electronic map between waypoints.

I will use the 100DaysOfCode as an excuse, an enabler if you will, to get back into this type of discovery. Along the way I will build a cognitive map of the tools that I choose to work on the the problems I wish to solve.

**Solving problems with:**

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- XML (really digging the sound of DITA)
- JSON (JSON-LD)
- who knows what else...

**Using**
- GitHub
- Brackets/Atom/Sublime Text (don't know which one is for me)

Maybe I will get around to explaining my choices some day. They are not random.
